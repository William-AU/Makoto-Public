Makoto Bot allows clans to track clan battle attacks, and coordinate attacks amongst their members. The bot integrates with Google Sheets so that clan leaders can observe current attacks remaining and used for each player for each day. Furthermore, the bot has a built in scheduling service where people can sign up for bosses they intend to hit, using the !schedule command.
